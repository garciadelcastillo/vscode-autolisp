# AutoLISP language for VSCode

AutoLISP language package for Visual Studio Code. 

AutoLISP is the scripting language of Autodesk's AutoCAD. It features a reduced set of LISP's original data types and functions, expanded to integrate geometry operations and functions for compliance with the [DXF specification](https://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/autocad_2012_pdf_dxf-reference_enu.pdf). You can learn more on the [AutoLISP Developer's Guide](http://docs.autodesk.com/ACDMAC/2013/ENU/PDFs/acdmac_2013_autolisp_developers_guide.pdf), or read the full specification on the [AutoLISP Reference Guide](http://docs.autodesk.com/ACDMAC/2013/ENU/PDFs/acdmac_2013_autolisp_reference_guide.pdf).
